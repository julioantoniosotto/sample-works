I graduated with a bachelor's degree in **computer science** from De La Salle Univeristy - Manila.

Iâ€™ve been working mainly as a web and app developer since 2012. Iâ€™m currently employed in IBM Business Services as a web/app developer based in Manila, Philippines. My most preferred stack for front-end development is **React**.

I'm functioning as a front-end developer since we have a separate team for the back-end but I also self study NodeJS just in case the team needs full-stack capabilities.

I'm a senior front-end developer and member of the team so part of the expectations of me are managing the junior devs and up-skilling them. In 2020 I led the dev team to create a **MERN stack project** (with the back-end coming from Udemy) to help them grow and I regularly check the performance of the devs.
