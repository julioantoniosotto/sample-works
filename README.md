# Gatsby Theme Carbon Starter

## What is this?

> Gatsby [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) encapsulate all of the
> configuration and implementation details of Gatsby websites. This is a
> starter-kit (boilerplate) with a dependancy on the `gatsby-theme-carbon`
> package. The primary goal of `gatsby-theme-carbon` is to get content authors
> speaking the IBM Design Language with Carbon as soon as possible. It includes
> some sample components/content demos in the `src/pages` directory.

## How do I use it?

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in dev mode on http://localhost:8000 and that's it!
